This file contains all the codes needed to compile parallelBlockMesh. As usual, compile using "wmake". No change in blockMesh library is needed. 

To make it work across different versions of OpenFOAM (mainly Foundation), add the following line to your bashrc:
export OFVN=$(echo ${WM_PROJECT_VERSION%%.*})
